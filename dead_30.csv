Additionally, the motivations for his attacks were to repeal immigration and naturalization laws as well as laws about sex.","08/06/1974: Muharem Kurbegovic, also known as ""Isak (Isaac) Rasim"" or the ""alphabet bomber,"" bombed the Pan American terminal of the Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California, in the United States, killing three people and injuring thirty-six others.  The bomb exploded in one of the coin-operated public lockers near the ticketing area of the terminal, and caused considerable damage including shattering several huge plate glass windows and leaving a 10 by 15 foot hole in the wall.  Kurbegovic apparently belonged to no organization and had no outside support; however, in a tape sent to the Herald-Examiner, he claimed he was the military officer of a group he called ""Aliens of America.""  Kurbegovic became known as the ""alphabet bomber"" because he picked his targets in alphabetical order.","The explosion occurred at 8:10am.  This may be a purely criminal act because Kurbegovic's motivations stemmed from personal vendetta's against a judge and commissioners who would not allow him to open up his own business, though he did have some political motivations as well. Kurbegovic claimed this attack by sending an audiotape to a CBS affiliate explaining his alphabet bombing method.  Kurbegovic also claimed responsibility for other attempted bombings, even though police doubt some of his claims.  Kurbegovic was arrested and eventually convicted in 1980 of 25 counts of Murder, Arson, Illegal Use of Explosives and relate d charges, and sentenced to life in prison.",39.0,1

This bomb was planted by Muharem Kurbegovic, also known as ""Isak (Isaac) Rasim"" or the ""alphabet bomber,"" who claimed the attempted bombing in a tape recording sent to the Herald-Examiner, identifying the locker where the bomb could be found.

During the two-hour siege, the men took three hostages, and destroyed computers and furniture, and spray painted slogans on walls.  None of the hostages, nor any other individuals were injured during the rampage; two hostages escaped when police broke through the back doors of the building, and the third hostage was released after the perpetrators surrendered to police negotiators.  A statement made by the Bonn headquarters of the People's Mujahideen stated the incident was in response to an Iranian air raid against the National Liberation Army (a military wing of the group) hiding in Iraq.  All five suspects were arrested and charged for this incident.","The hostage takeover occurred at 1:47PM and lasted until about 3:30PM, when the third hostage was released and the perpetrators surrendered.  This Incident was one in a series of Missions attacks in 10 different nations on this day in protest of the Iranian air raid against government rebels hiding in Iraq.  This was the only incident that occurred in the United States.  The five perpetrators were arrested at the scene, and eventually indicted for their crimes.",0.0,0

The attack was a part of a series of ten bombs that exploded on trains on Madrid's commuter line during the morning rush hour, killing 191 people and wounding more than 1800 others. Police initially accused the Basque separatist group Euskadi ta Askatasuna (ETA) of the attack, which occurred three days before Spain's general election, but Islamic extremists were soon found to be the perpetrators. Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades, a group said to be associated with Al-Qa ida, claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was retribution for Spain's cooperation with the United States in the Iraq War.  Islamic extremists influenced by Al-Qa ida were held responsible for the attacks and it is unknown if the Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades claim of responsibility is valid. Twenty nine suspects, mostly Moroccans, have since been charged for the attacks, with the trial commencing in February 2007.","This was one of six related attacks (cf. 20040311001; 20040311003-07). The injury and property damage figures were reported cumulatively for the four blasts, so they have been divided equally across the cases in order to preserve the statistical accuracy of the database. After the attacks, police discovered a stolen van containing seven detonators and an Arabic language tape near the Atocha station. London-based newspaper Al-Qods al-Arabi received an email claiming responsibility from Abu Hafs al-Masri Brigades on the day of the attack and a videotape found at a mosque in Madrid two days later also claimed responsibility by that group. On April 3, 2004, seven key suspects committed suicide during a police raid on their Madrid apartment; among of whom was Jamal Ahmidan, a Moroccan believed to have been the central figure in the financing, planning and execution of the attacks. According to the Associated Press, it cost the perpetrators $120,000 to carry out the attacks, ranging from the cost of buying explosives to renting safe-houses. Of the 29 charged, three men were charged with murder: Jamal Zougam, a Moroccan merchant who allegedly supplied the cell phones used as detonators; Emilio Suarez Trashorras, a Spaniard accused of supplying the dynamite; and Abdelmajid Bouchar, a Moroccan. Rabei Osman, an Egyptian who claimed that the attacks were his idea, is among three other men accused of conspiracy to commit murder.",512.0,1

Authorities later indentified the head of the suicide bomber at the scene. No group claimed responsibility for the attack.","--The event at Nishtar Park was the biggest such celebration in Pakistan, and about 50,000 people had gathered for the ceremony, including several prominent religious figures who were seated on a wooden stage directly at the center of the explosion. Prominent religious personalities, including Tehrik Awam Ahli-Sunnat chief Haji Mohammad Hanif Billo, Itikhar Bhatti, Abbas Qadri, Akram Qadri and Hafiz Mohammd Taqi, died in the blast. Investigators were looking into the fact that there might have been two suicide bombers or if the bomb was remote control, and later decided it was a suicide attack. --Soon after Tuesday's bombing, violence erupted in nearby southern areas of Karachi, where support runs high for Tehrik, Karachi's largest Sunni Muslim religious group, which had grieved that not enough security had been provided to their leaders and whose head died in this incident, as groups of youths burned at least three gas stations, buses, a fire truck, police van and ambulance. Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal [MMA] chief Qazi Hussain Ahmed blamed the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), which had killed Sunni Tehrik leaders in the past. Suspicions as to who was behind the attack varied greatly, and the attack gained attention and comment around the world. --A three day mourning period afterwards was declared, which affected daily business. -- On 06/15/07, the Sindh Home Department identified Lashkar-e Jhangvi as the network behind the attack and Mohammad Siddiq as the bomber by matching the DNA taken from his head with that of his brother. Of the six remaining suspects involved, Mohammad Amin and Sultan were already in custody for the Allama Hasan Turabi murder case, and Mufti Zakir and Rehmatullah were arrested on June 15.
